# Caching

`@lazarv/react-server` provides a caching mechanism for the rendering response and a built-in in-memory cache for any value with TTL outage and compound cache keys.

<Link name="response-cache">
## Response Cache
</Link>

You can enable response caching when you use a server component with the `withCache` wrapper or using the `useResponseCache` hook. Not only the wrapped component or the component where you used the cache hook will be cached, but the entire HTTP response where the cache was enabled.

The response cache is using both a cache provider and HTTP `Cache-Control` with `stale-while-revalidate`. The server-side cache is used for any subsequent requests until the cache is invalidated. The client-side cache is used for any subsequent requests from the same client.

```jsx
import { withCache } from "@lazarv/react-server";

export default withCache(async function App() {
  return <div>{Math.random()}</div>;
}, 30 * 1000);
```

```jsx
import { useResponseCache } from "@lazarv/react-server";

export default async function App() {
  useResponseCache(30 * 1000);

  return <div>{Math.random()}</div>;
}
```

<Link name="in-memory-cache">
## In-memory Cache
</Link>

You can use the in-memory cache by importing the `useCache` helper function from `@lazarv/react-server`. You can use this caching solution to cache any async value with a TTL outage and a compound cache key. The cache is shared between all server components.

```jsx
import { useCache } from "@lazarv/react-server";
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

export default async function FileContent({ filename }) {
  const file = await useCache(
    ["file", filename],
    async () => readFile(filename, "utf-8"),
    30 * 1000,
  );

  return <pre>{file}</pre>;
}
```

<Link name="revalidate">
## Revalidate
</Link>

You can use the `revalidate` function to revalidate the cache using a compound key. Calling this function will instantly invalidate the cache for the given key. This function is only available in server components.

```jsx
import { revalidate } from "@lazarv/react-server";

export default async function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FileContent filename="temp.txt" />
      <form
        action={async () => {
          "use server";
          revalidate(["file", filename]);
          redirect("/");
        }}
      >
        <button type="submit">Refresh</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Link name="use-cache">
## "use cache" directive
</Link>

The `"use cache"` directive can be used to enable caching in any function. The directive accepts the `profile`, `ttl`, and `tags` options. The `profile` option is used to specify the cache profile to use. The `ttl` option is used to specify the time-to-live for the cache in milliseconds, which overrides the `ttl` option from the cache profile. The `tags` option is used to specify the tags for the cache key.

You can use the `tags` option to specify a comma-separated list of tags to address when invalidating the cache for a specific group of tags. For example, if you have a function that fetches todos and you want to invalidate the cache for all todos, you can use the `tags` option to add the `todos` tag to the cache key.

```jsx filename="App.jsx"
import { invalidate } from "@lazarv/react-server";

async function getTodos() {
  "use cache; ttl=200; tags=todos";
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
  return {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    data: await res.json(),
  };
}

export default async function App() {
  const todos = await getTodos();
  return (
    <form
      action={async () => {
        "use server";
        await invalidate(getTodos);
      }}
    >
      <button type="submit">Refresh</button>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(todos, null, 2)}</pre>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Cache profiles are defined in the server configuration. You can specify any number of cache profiles and reference them by name in the `"use cache"` directive. The cache profile can include the `ttl` and `tags` options which will be used when the `"use cache"` directive does not specify them.

```json filename="react-server.config.json"
{
  "cache": {
    "profiles": {
      "todos": { "ttl": 30000, "tags": "todos" }
    }
  }
}
```

After defining the cache profiles, you can reference them by name in the `"use cache"` directive.

```jsx filename="App.jsx"
async function getTodos() {
  "use cache; profile=todos";
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
  return {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    data: await res.json(),
  };
}
```

<Link name="cache-providers">
## Cache providers
</Link>

You can use different cache providers to store the cached data. The default cache provider is an in-memory cache, but you can also use file-based caching or any other custom cache provider.

To use a specific cache provider with the `"use cache"` directive, you can specify provider by using the `"use cache: <provider>;"` syntax. This allows you to use different cache providers for different parts of your application.

```jsx
async function getTodos() {
  "use cache: file; tags=todos";
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
  return {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    data: await res.json(),
  };
}
```

`@lazarv/react-server` uses the [Unstorage](https://github.com/unstorage/unstorage) library to provide a unified API for different storage backends. You can use any of the available drivers, such as `fs`, `localStorage`, `memory`, or any custom driver you create.

With cache providers, you can use the `"use cache"` directive even with `"use client"` components. This allows you to cache data on the client side and use it in your client components. You can use the built-in `local` or `session` cache providers to store the cached data in the browser's local storage or session storage, while you can use an existing or implement a new custom cache driver to store the cached data in a different storage backend, like the `indexedb` driver from Unstorage.

To define the cache provider, you can use the `cache.providers` option in the server configuration. The `driver` option specifies the driver using the module path, and the `options` option specifies the options for the driver.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    providers: {
      file: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/fs",
        options: {
          base: ".cache",
        },
      }
    }
  },
};
```

You can also set a special option for your provider, called `type`, to indicate the type of the cache provider. This is useful for `@lazarv/react-server` to know how to handle the cached value. Set `type` to `"raw"` to use `setItemRaw` from Unstorage when storing the cache value. This is useful for caching memory structs, like a React tree, without encoding them to a string when using an in-memory cache driver, like LRU.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    providers: {
      file: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/lru",
        options: {
          type: "raw",
        },
      }
    }
  },
};
```

You can also use the `cache.provider` option to set the default cache provider for the server. This will be used when no specific cache provider is specified in the `"use cache"` directive.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    provider: {
      default: "unstorage/drivers/lru",
    },
  },
};
```

You can also specify cache provider aliases in the server configuration. This allows you to route cache requests to different providers based on the alias used in the `"use cache"` directive. You can also override the default cache provider for specific aliases.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    provider: {
      default: "lru",
      lru: "unstorage/drivers/lru",
    },
  },
};
```

Using cache provider aliases allows you to easily switch between different cache providers without changing the code in your application. This allows you to switch between different caching strategies, such as in-memory caching, file-based caching, or any other custom caching solution, without modifying the code that uses the cache, or cache provider configurations using the same storage driver.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    provider: {
      default: "smallLRU",
      smallLRU: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/lru",
        options: {
          maxSize: 1000, // Set a smaller size for this alias
          type: "raw",
        },
      },
      largeLRU: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/lru",
        options: {
          maxSize: 10000, // Set a larger size for this alias
          type: "raw",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Built-in cache providers

`@lazarv/react-server` provides a few built-in cache providers that you can use out of the box without any configuration. These are:

- `memory`: A simple in-memory cache provider. This is the default cache provider.
- `request`: A cache provider that only lives for the duration of the request. This is useful for caching data that is only needed for the current request.
- `null`: A cache provider that does not store any data. This is useful for disabling caching in specific parts of your application. Useful with a cache provider alias.
- `local`: A cache provider that uses the browser's local storage. This is useful for caching data that needs to persist across page reloads.
- `session`: A cache provider that uses the browser's session storage. This is useful for caching data that needs to persist across page reloads, but only for the current session.

## RSC serialization

Storing a React component with a cache provider which is not an in-memory caching solution needs the component to be serialized. You can use the RSC format to save the component state. To use the RSC serialization in a cache provider, you can set the `type` option to `rsc` in the cache provider configuration. This will use the RSC serialization format when storing the component in the cache.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    providers: {
      file: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/fs",
        options: {
          base: ".cache",
          type: "rsc",
        },
      }
    }
  },
};
```

You can also specify the encoding for the stored RSC data, which is `base64` by default. You can set any standard Node.js buffer encoding, such as `utf8`, `hex`, or `binary`. This is useful for storing the RSC data in a specific format that is compatible with your storage backend. To specify the encoding, you can set the `type` option to `rsc;<encoding>` or the `encoding` option in the cache provider configuration. You can use the `encoding` option for your cache driver when necessary, by specifying the `encoding` with the `type` option. This is useful for storing your cached data with different encodings when the cache driver supports it's own `encoding` option.

```mjs
export default {
  cache: {
    providers: {
      file: {
        driver: "unstorage/drivers/fs",
        options: {
          base: ".cache",
          type: "rsc;utf8",
          // or
          type: "rsc",
          encoding: "utf8",
        },
      }
    }
  },
};
```

The RSC serializer is available for you to use for your own needs. You can use the `@lazarv/react-server/rsc` module to convert a React tree to a buffer or stream and back. The buffer is an `Uint8Array` instance and the stream is a `ReadableStream` instance. You can use the `toBuffer` and `fromBuffer` functions to convert a React tree to a buffer and back, or the `toStream` and `fromStream` functions to convert a React tree to a stream and back.

```jsx
import { toBuffer, fromBuffer } from "@lazarv/react-server/rsc";

const buffer = await toBuffer(<div>Hello world</div>);
const tree = await fromBuffer(buffer);

const stream = await toStream(<div>Hello world</div>);
const tree = await fromStream(stream);
```

> You can only access RSC serialization in server components for now, but it might be available in the future in a browser environment. Stay tuned for updates!
