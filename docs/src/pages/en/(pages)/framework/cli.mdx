# CLI

The `react-server` CLI is the main tool for developing and deploying your `@lazarv/react-server` applications. It provides a set of commands to help you build, run, and deploy your app.

To check out the available commands, run:

```sh
pnpm react-server --help
```

## Commands
</Link>

You need to always define the entrypoint of your app as the first argument of the `react-server` command. Only exception is when you use the file-system based router as it will define the entrypoint for you.

- **[root]**: start development server for your app
- **build [root]**: build your app for production
- **start**: start your app in production

The `[root]` of your app has to export default a React Server Component. This is the entrypoint of your app and this will be rendered on the server side for every request.

You can also use a hash fragment in the entrypoint to specify a specific export. For example, if you have an entrypoint at `./index.jsx` and you want to use the `App` export, you can use `./index.jsx#App`.

If your entrypoint is at `./App.jsx`, you can start the development server with:

```sh
pnpm react-server ./App.jsx
```

To start the development server, you can use the following options:

**host:** The host to listen on. Default is `localhost`.

**port:** The port to listen on. Default is `3000`.

**https:** Use HTTPS protocol. Default is `false`.  
When you want to use HTTPS for your development server. You need to specify your HTTPS configuration in your `react-server.config.mjs` or `vite.config.mjs` file. See details in the Vite documentation at [server.https](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https).

**open:** Open browser on server start. Default is `false`.  
Opens your app in the default browser.

**cors:** Enable CORS. Default is `false`.  
This is useful when you want to allow cross-origin requests. If you need more detailed CORS configuration, you can define the CORS configuration in your `react-server.config.mjs` or `vite.config.mjs` file. See details in the Vite documentation at [server.cors](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors).

**force:** Force optimize deps. Default is `false`.  
This is equal to `vite --force`. It will force the optimization of dependencies and clears the Vite cache.

**watch:** Watch for config changes. Default is `true`.  
To disable watching for config changes, use `--no-watch`.

**clear-screen:** Clear screen on server start. Default is `false`.  
If you want to start with a clean terminal screen.

**no-color:** Disable color output. Default is `false`.  
This is useful for CI/CD environments.

**eval:** Evaluate the server entrypoint from the argument, like `node -e`. You can also use _stdin_ as the entrypoint. This type of entrypoint becomes a virtualized entrypoint and is not written to the file system.

**version:** Display version number.  
Output will also include your machine's architecture and node.js version.

**outDir:** Output directory for the build. Default is `.react-server`.

**name:** Name of the server. Default is `react-server`. Used for logging.

**minify:** Minify your build. Default is `true`.  
You don't need to minify your app if you only use React Server Components and you are not using any client components, like in the [Todo](https://github.com/lazarv/react-server/tree/main/examples/todo) example. If you want to disable minification of client component code, use `--no-minify`.

**sourcemap:** Generate source map. Default is `false`.
See more details in the Vite documentation at [build.sourcemap](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-sourcemap).

**no-color:** Disable color output. Default is `false`.  
This is useful for CI/CD environments.

**server:** Build server. Default is `true`.  
You can disable server build if you only want to build the client part of your app. Use `--no-server` to disable server build.

**client:** Build client. Default is `true`.  
You can disable client build if you only want to build the server part of your app. Use `--no-client` to disable client build.

**export:** Static export. Default is `false`.  
You can export your app as static HTML pages. You can define the routes to export in your `react-server.config.mjs` file. See more details at [Static generation](/router/static).

**compression:** Enable compression. Default is `false`.  
You can enable compression if you want to compress your static build. Compression is not enabled by default for static builds. Gzip and Brotli compression is used when compression is enabled. The production mode server serves these compressed files by default when the compressed static files are present.

**deploy:** Deploy using adapter. Default is `false`.
If you use an adapter in your `react-server.config.mjs` file, the adapter will pre-build your app for deployment and when you use this argument, the adapter will also deploy your app at the end of the build process.

**eval:** Evaluate the server entrypoint from the argument, like `node -e`. You can also use _stdin_ as the entrypoint. This type of entrypoint becomes a virtualized entrypoint and is not written to the file system.

**outDir:** Output directory for the build. Default is `.react-server`.

**host**, **port**, **https** and **cors** are the same as in the development server options.

**origin:**  
Specify the origin part of the URL to a constant value. Same as using the `ORIGIN` environment variable.

**trust-proxy:**
Trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

See more details about `origin` and `trust-proxy` at the Hattip documentation at [@hattip/adapter-node](https://github.com/hattipjs/hattip/tree/main/packages/adapter/adapter-node#api).

**build:**
Runs the build command before starting the server using the provided entrypoint.

**outDir:** Output directory for the build. Default is `.react-server`. You need to specify this option if you used a different output directory in the build command than the default.
