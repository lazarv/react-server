# Configuration

To configure the behavior of the framework, you need to create a `react-server.config.*` or `+*.config.*` file in the root of your project. This file is used to configure the server and the build process. The file type could be `.js`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.mts` or `.json`.

You can use the `+*.config.*` file to extend the configuration of the framework. The `+*.config.*` file is merged with the `react-server.config.*` file.

The `+*.config.*` file is useful when you want to extend the configuration of the framework. You can use as many `+*.config.*` files as you want. All the configuration files are merged together in the order they are loaded.

If you want to only add configuration to use when running the framework in production mode, then use the `.production.config.*` extension. These configuration files only loaded in production mode.

In a similar way, you can create configuration files with the `.development.config.*` extension to use a different configuration for development mode.

To add configuration to the build process, you can create `.build.config.*` files and these configuration files will only be used during a production build.

Configuration files with the `.runtime.config.*` or `.server.config.*` extensions are not used during the build process.

The configuration object you need to export as default is an extension of the Vite config object. You can find the full list of options [here](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

<Link name="vite-configuration">
## Vite configuration
</Link>

To provide full control over the Vite configuration, you can use the `vite` option to configure the Vite server and the build process. The `vite` option is an object that extends the Vite config object or a function that returns a new Vite config object. As a function you can discover and mutate the default configuration for Vite.

You can also use a `vite.config.*` file to configure Vite as you would do in a Vite project. The `vite.config.*` file is merged with the `react-server.config.*` file.

Best practice is to use a `vite.config.*` file to configure Vite as you would do in a Vite project and use the `react-server.config.*` file to configure the framework specific options.

## Additional configuration

The following options are specific to the `@lazarv/react-server` framework.

<Link name="runtime">
#### Runtime
</Link>

Add new entries to the runtime context. The runtime context is a singleton store and can be used to share state in your application.

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "myEntry": "myValue"
  }
}
```

The `runtime` option can also be a function that returns the runtime context object. This is useful when you want to mutate the runtime context.

```mjs
export default {
  runtime: (runtime) => {
    return {
      ...runtime,
      myEntry: "myValue",
    };
  },
};
```

<Link name="cookies">
#### Cookies
</Link>

Provide cookies configuration, see available options [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie#options-1).

```mjs
export default {
  cookies: {
    path: "/",
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
    secure: true,
    httpOnly: true,
    sameSite: "lax",
  },
};
```

<Link name="handlers">
#### Handlers
</Link>

You can add `pre` and `post` handlers to the Hattip middleware stack. You can define the async handler functions in an array for both `pre` and `post` options. See more details about Hattip handlers [here](https://github.com/hattipjs/hattip).

```mjs
export default {
  handlers: {
    pre: [async () { ... }],
    post: [async () { ... }]
  }
}
```

The `handlers` option can also be a function that returns the handlers array. This is useful when you want to mutate the middlewares used.

```mjs
export default {
  handlers: (handlers) => {
    return [...handlers, async () { ... }];
  }
}
```

Or the `handlers` option can be an array, where the array of handlers will be used as `post` handlers.

<Link name="public">
#### Public directory
</Link>

The public directory is the directory where the static assets are served from. The default value is `public`.

<Link name="module-preload">
#### Module preload
</Link>

To disable the automatic module preloading of client components, you can use the `modulePreload` option. The `modulePreload` option can be a boolean value or a function that returns a boolean value. The function can also be an async function. When the `modulePreload` option evaluates to `false`, the modules for the client components will not be preloaded.

```json
{
  "modulePreload": false
}
```

Using a function to disable the module preloading of client components:

```mjs
export default {
  modulePreload: () => false,
};
```

As the whole application context is available in the function, you can use all helpers or hooks provided by the framework to determine whether to preload the client components.

```mjs
import { usePathname } from "@lazarv/react-server";

export default {
  modulePreload: () => {
    const pathname = usePathname();
    return pathname !== "/";
  },
};
```
