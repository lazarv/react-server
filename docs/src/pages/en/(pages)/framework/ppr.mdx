# Partial pre-rendering

When you have a page that contains a static shell and dynamic content, you can use partial pre-rendering to pre-render only the static content and then the framework will use the pre-rendered content and a state stored in a JSON file to continue rendering the dynamic content on demand.

You can split your JSX to static and dynamic content by using Suspense and marking dynamic components by using the `usePrerender` hook or the `withPrerender` higher-order component helper function. The marked component's rendering will be "postponed" for rendering it at runtime in the production server using the pre-rendered HTML content and the JSON state.

```jsx
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { usePrerender } from "@lazarv/react-server/prerender";

async function DynamicComponent() {
  usePrerender();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return <div>Dynamic content</div>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Static content</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <DynamicComponent data={data} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

To enable partial pre-rendering, you will also need to export your pre-rendered pages as static pages. To do so, add `export` to your `react-server.config.mjs`. See more details about static exporting at [Static generation](/router/static).

```js
export default {
  export(paths) {
    return [
      ...paths,
      { path: "/" }
    ]
  }
};
```

When you run the `build` command, the framework will pre-render the pages you have exported and store the pre-rendered content in the `.react-server` folder of your project. The pre-rendered content will be used by the production server to render the pages faster.

To disable partial pre-rendering, add `prerender: false` to your `react-server.config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  prerender: false
};
```
