# Get Started

Nothing is easier to get started with React Server Components than `@lazarv/react-server`. You can use the `react-server` CLI as you would node.js. As soon as you have a file with a server component exported as default, you can run it with `react-server`. Your application can be a single file for micro-applications or even use the file-system based router to create a full-fledged complex application.

<Link name="prerequisites">
## Prerequisites
</Link>

You will only need node.js and a package manager to get started. We suggest the latest node.js runtime and pnpm as the package manager, but you can use any package manager you would like to.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20.10.0 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

or when using Bun as your JavaScript runtime, you don't need anything else, just use Bun.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1.45 or higher

> **Note:** Deno is not supported yet. Please check back later for updates.

## Install

Just add `@lazarv/react-server` to your project. You will not need anything else to get started with a micro-application.

## Our first application
</Link>

Just by creating an `App.jsx` file and exporting a React Server Component as default makes your application ready to run.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}
```

<Link name="development-mode">
## Development mode
</Link>

To start your application in development mode, you can use the `react-server` CLI simply by passing the path to your application entry file. By using the `--open` flag, your application will be opened in your default browser on http://localhost:3000.

<Tabs name="development-mode">

<Tab title={<><Pnpm className="w-4 max-h-4" />pnpm</>}>
```sh
pnpm react-server ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/npm.svg" alt="npm" className="w-4" />npm</>}>
```sh
npx react-server ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/yarn.svg" alt="yarn" className="w-4" />Yarn</>}>
```sh
yarn react-server ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/bun.svg" alt="bun" className="w-4" />Bun</>}>
```sh
bun --bun react-server ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><Deno className="w-4 max-h-4" />Deno</>}>

> **Note:** Deno is not supported yet. Please check back later for updates.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

> **Note:** if you want to open the application in your default browser, you can use the `--open` flag.

<Link name="build">
## Build
</Link>

After you have developed your application, you can build it for production. This will create a `.react-server` folder with all files needed to run your application in production mode.

<Tabs name="build">

<Tab title={<><Pnpm className="w-4 max-h-4" />pnpm</>}>
```sh
pnpm react-server build ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/npm.svg" alt="npm" className="w-4" />npm</>}>
```sh
npx react-server build ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/yarn.svg" alt="yarn" className="w-4" />Yarn</>}>
```sh
yarn react-server build ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/bun.svg" alt="bun" className="w-4" />Bun</>}>
```sh
bun --bun react-server build ./App.jsx
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><Deno className="w-4 max-h-4" />Deno</>}>

> **Note:** Deno is not supported yet. Please check back later for updates.

</Tabs>

<Link name="production-mode">
## Production mode
</Link>

To start your application in production, just use the `start` command. This will start your application in production mode.

<Tabs name="production-mode">

<Tab title={<><Pnpm className="w-4 max-h-4" />pnpm</>}>
```sh
pnpm react-server start
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/npm.svg" alt="npm" className="w-4" />npm</>}>
```sh
npx react-server start
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/yarn.svg" alt="yarn" className="w-4" />Yarn</>}>
```sh
yarn react-server start
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><img src="/bun.svg" alt="bun" className="w-4" />Bun</>}>
```sh
bun --bun react-server start
```
</Tab>

<Tab title={<><Deno className="w-4 max-h-4" />Deno</>}>

> **Note:** Deno is not supported yet. Please check back later for updates.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

> **Note:** if you don't want to install the `@lazarv/react-server` package and you just want to try out something quickly, you can use `npx` to run the `react-server` CLI. This way, it's not required to install anything else if you use JavaScript. It's enough to have a `.jsx` file with a React Server Component exported as default to run your application. Just run `npx @lazarv/react-server ./App.jsx` to start your application in development mode. When using Bun, you can use `bunx --bun @lazarv/react-server` to run the `react-server` CLI.

Success! You have now created your first application using `@lazarv/react-server`.

Here are some recommended topics to learn more about. You can read these in any order you would like. You can even leave for now to start building your application and come back when you run into trouble or have a question.

> Don't forget that you can join a discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/lazarv/react-server/discussions) if you have any questions or need help.
