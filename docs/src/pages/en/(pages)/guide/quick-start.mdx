# Quick Start

Welcome to the `@lazarv/react-server` documentation! To start using this framework, just create a file exporting a React Server Component as default and run the `@lazarv/react-server` command using `npx` with the path to the file. You need nothing else to start your first server-side rendered React application! Painfully simple, right?

```jsx filename="./App.jsx"
export default function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

```sh
npx @lazarv/react-server ./App.jsx
```
