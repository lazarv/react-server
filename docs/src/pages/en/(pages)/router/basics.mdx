# Basics

In this chapter we will learn about the basics of the file-system based router. We will learn how to create routes, how to use parameters and how to use the router in a project.

<Link name="configuration">
## Configuration
</Link>

The router can be configured by creating a `react-server.config.mjs` or `react-server.config.json` file in the root of your project. The configuration file should export a configuration object and it should include the `root` path for your routes. You can also specify a `public` path for your static files. The `@lazarv/react-server-router` package will automatically scaffold the files in the root directory for routing and prepares and builds the routing based on your files in the root directory.

```js
export default {
  root: "src/pages",
  public: "public",
};
```

<Link name="creating-routes">
## Creating Routes
</Link>

Your directories and files specify the routes your application will use. There are built-in conventions in the router which translates the names of directories and files to route paths and route parameters. To create a new route you need to create a file in the root directory.

Route files have to export default a React Server Component which will be used to render the route.

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Home</h1>;
}
```

<Link name="index-routes">
### Index routes
</Link>

If you name your file `index` or `page` it will be treated as an index route. Index routes are the default routes for directories. For example if you create a file named `index.jsx` in the root directory it will be treated as the default route for your application. If you create a file named `index.jsx` in a directory named `about` it will be treated as the default route for the `about` directory.

<Link name="named-routes">
### Named routes
</Link>

If you name your file anything other than `index` or `page` it will be treated as a named route. For example if you create a file named `about.jsx` in the root directory it will be treated as a named route with the path `/about`. If you create a file named `about.jsx` in a directory named `users` it will be treated as a named route with the path `/users/about`.

<Link name="nested-routes">
### Nested routes
</Link>

You can create nested routes by creating directories in the root directory. For example if you create a directory named `users` in the root directory and create a file named `index.jsx` in the `users` directory it will be treated as a nested route with the path `/users`. If you create a file named `about.jsx` in the `users` directory it will be treated as a nested route with the path `/users/about`.

<Link name="route-parameters">
### Route parameters
</Link>

You can create route parameters by adding a parameter name in brackets to the name of the file. For example if you create a file named `[id].jsx` in the root directory it will be treated as a named route with the path `/[id]`. If you create a file named `[id].jsx` in a directory named `users` it will be treated as a named route with the path `/users/[id]`. You can also create nested route parameters by creating nested directories. For example if you create a directory named `users` in the root directory and create a file named `[id].jsx` in the `users` directory it will be treated as a nested route with the path `/users/[id]`. You will be able to access the route parameter in your component as React props.

```jsx
export default function User({ id }) {
  return <h1>User #{id}</h1>;
}
```

You can also use multiple route parameters in a single route segment. For example if you create a file named `[id]-[name].jsx` it will be treated as a route with the path pattern of `/[id]-[name]` and you will receive both `id` and `name` as props in your component.

```jsx
export default function User({ id, name }) {
  return <h1>User #{id} - {name}</h1>;
}
```

<Link name="route-parameters-for-multiple-segments">
### Route parameters for multiple segments
</Link>

You can create route parameters for multiple segments by adding a parameter name in brackets to the name of the file. For example if you create a file named `[...id].jsx` in the root directory it will be treated as a named route with the path `/[...id]`. If you create a file named `[...id].jsx` in a directory named `users` it will be treated as a named route with the path `/users/[...id]`. You can also create nested route parameters by creating nested directories. For example if you create a directory named `users` in the root directory and create a file named `[...id].jsx` in the `users` directory it will be treated as a nested route with the path `/users/[...id]`.

The parameter at runtime will be an array of strings. You will be able to access the route parameter in your component as a React prop.

```jsx
// /[...slug].page.jsx
export default function Page({ slug }) {
  return <h1>/{slug.join("/")}</h1>;
}
```

<Link name="route-parameters-for-optional-segments">
### Route parameters for optional segments
</Link>

You can create route parameters for optional segments by adding a parameter name in brackets to the name of the file. For example if you create a file named `[[...id]].jsx` in the root directory it will be treated as a named route with the path `/[[...id]]`. If you create a file named `[[...id]].jsx` in a directory named `users` it will be treated as a named route with the path `/users/[[...id]]`. You can also create nested route parameters by creating nested directories. For example if you create a directory named `users` in the root directory and create a file named `[[...id]].jsx` in the `users` directory it will be treated as a nested route with the path `/users/[[...id]]`.

> **Omit:** you can omit any part of the directory or file name by wrapping the part in parentheses. For example if you create a file named `(404).[[...slug]].page.mdx` in the root directory it will be treated as a route with the path `/[[...slug]]`. You can use this to extend the directory/file name with additional information without affecting the route path.

<Link name="layouts">
## Layouts
</Link>

You can create layouts by creating a file including `layout.jsx` in the file name. The layout file will be used to wrap all the routes in the same directory where the layout file is. You can also create nested layouts by creating a file named `layout.jsx` in a sub-directory. You can also use omitted parts in the layout file name. For example if you create a file named `(root).layout.jsx` in the root directory it will be used as the layout for all the routes in the root directory.

Your layout component will receive a `children` prop which you need to use to render your route components.

```jsx
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Layout</h1>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

<Link name="escape-route-segments">
## Escape route segments
</Link>

You can escape route segments by wrapping the segment in curly braces. For example if you create a file named `{sitemap.xml}.server.mjs` in the root directory it will be treated as a named route with the path `/sitemap.xml`.

> **Example:** see the Photos example in the [examples](https://github.com/lazarv/react-server/tree/main/examples/photos) directory for a basic example of file-system based routing.

<Link name="typed-routes">
## Typed routes
</Link>

The router supports typed routes out of the box. If you use TypeScript, you can include the generated types in your project and all of your routes will be type checked. Typed routes work for `Link` components, `useMatch` hooks, `navigate`, `replace` and `prefetch` functions from the `useClient` hook and also the possible outlets available to use in a `ReactServerComponent`.

To include the generated types in your project you only need to include `.ts` files from the `.react-server` directory in your TypeScript configuration. To do so, add `.react-server/**/*.ts` to the `include` array in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [/* ... */, ".react-server/**/*.ts"]
}
```
