# Configuration

The router can be configured by creating a `react-server.config.mjs` or `react-server.config.json` file in the root of your project. The configuration file should export a configuration object and it should include the `root` path for your routes. You can also specify a `public` path for your static files. The file-system based router will automatically scaffold the files in the root directory for routing and prepares and builds the routing based on your files in the root directory.

```js filename="react-server.config.mjs"
export default {
  root: "src/pages",
  public: "public",
};
```

<Link name="private-files-and-directories">
## Private files and directories
</Link>

You can configure the router to exclude files and directories from the routing by using the `router(config)` function in the configuration. The function should return a configuration object with the `excludes` property containing an array of file and directory names to exclude from the routing. You can use glob patterns to exclude multiple files and directories.

```js filename="react-server.config.mjs"
export default {
  root: "src/pages",
  public: "public",
  router(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      excludes: ["_*"],
    };
  },
};
```

You can also use the same functionality on different types of routes by defining type specific configurator functions. The `router` function will be called for all types of routes, but you can define `layout`, `page`, `middleware` and `api` functions to configure the routing for different types of routes.

```js filename="react-server.config.mjs"
export default {
  root: "src/pages",
  public: "public",
  router(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Exclude all files and directories starting with an underscore
      excludes: ["_*"],
    };
  },
  layout(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Exclude all layout files including the word "private"
      excludes: ["*private*"],
    };
  },
  page(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Exclude all page files starting with "hidden-"
      excludes: ["hidden-*"],
    };
  },
  middleware(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Exclude all middleware files starting with "disabled-"
      excludes: ["disabled-*"],
    };
  },
  api(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Exclude all API files containing the word "PATCH"
      excludes: ["*PATCH*"],
    };
  },
};
```

<Link name="include-files-and-directories">
## Include files and directories
</Link>

You can configure the router to include only specific files and directories from the routing by using the `router(config)` function in the configuration. The function should return a configuration object with the `includes` property containing an array of file and directory names to include from the routing. You can use glob patterns to include multiple files and directories.

```js filename="react-server.config.mjs"
export default {
  root: "src/pages",
  public: "public",
  router(config) {
    return {
      ...config,
      // Include only the about page
      includes: ["about.page.jsx"],
    };
  },
};
```
