# Error handling

Error handling is an important part of any application. The file-system based router allows you to define custom error components for each layout of your app. When a page fails to render, the error component will be rendered instead. You can also define a fallback component that will be used when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

You can define a custom error component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `error.jsx`. This file will be used to render the error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page.

```jsx
// (root).error.jsx

export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

<Link name="fallback">
## Fallback
</Link>

You can also define a fallback component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `fallback.jsx`. This file will be used to render the fallback component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

```jsx
// (root).fallback.jsx

export default function FallbackError({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

> **Warning:** you can define an error boundary, error fallback or loading component only for layouts, not for pages.

## Global error component
</Link>

By default, the global error component is the first `react-server.error.jsx` or `react-server.error.tsx` file found from the root of your app. This component will be used to render the error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

Your global error component will be used for all errors that are not handled by a more specific error component. The error component will receive the error as a prop.

```jsx
// src/app/react-server.error.tsx
export default function GlobalError({ error }: { error: Error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

Optionally, you can specify the global error component in the `react-server.config.json` file. You only need to specify the path to the file when you want to use a file that is not named `react-server.error.jsx` or `react-server.error.tsx`, like `global-error.tsx` or similar, or when you want to use a file specifically for the global error component and not the first the framework can find with the default name.

```jsx
// react-server.config.json
{
  "globalErrorComponent": "src/app/react-server.error.tsx"
}
```

Your global error component can be a React Server Component or a client component. When it's a client component, it will be rendered on the client side using a React error boundary, while if it's a React Server Component, it will be rendered on the server side only.

> **Warning:** you can't reset a global error boundary! The page needs to be reloaded to reset the error boundary. Use the `Refresh` component to reload the page using the React Server Component payload. It's recommended to use the `noCache` prop on the `Refresh` component to avoid caching issues.
