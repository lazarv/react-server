# Error handling

Error handling is an important part of any application. The file-system based router allows you to define custom error components for each layout of your app. When a page fails to render, the error component will be rendered instead. You can also define a fallback component that will be used when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

You can define a custom error component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `error.jsx`. This file will be used to render the error component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page.

```jsx
// (root).error.jsx

export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

<Link name="fallback">
## Fallback
</Link>

You can also define a fallback component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `fallback.jsx`. This file will be used to render the fallback component when an error occurs during the rendering of a page and no error component is defined for the error.

```jsx
// (root).fallback.jsx

export default function FallbackError({ error }) {
  return <div>{error.message}</div>;
}
```

> **Warning:** you can define an error boundary, error fallback or loading component only for layouts, not for pages.
