# Loading

Loading components are used to render a loading state while the page is being fetched.

<Link name="implementation">
## Implementation
</Link>

You can define a custom loading component by creating a route definition file for any path by using the same rules like normal route files, but named `loading.jsx`. This file will be used to render the loader component while the page is being fetched.

```jsx
// (root).loading.jsx

export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

When you add a loading component or a fallback error component beside your layout, the router will enable partial pre-rendering for the page it renders automatically. To disable partial pre-rendering, add `prerender: false` to your `react-server.config.mjs`. See more details at [Partial pre-rendering](/framework/ppr).

> **Warning:** you can define an error boundary, error fallback or loading component only for layouts, not for pages.
