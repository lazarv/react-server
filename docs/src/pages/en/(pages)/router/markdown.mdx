# Markdown

The file-system based router supports Markdown out of the box. Not just standard Markdown files, but also MDX and any plugin for both Remark and Rehype.

<Link name="usage">
## Usage
</Link>

To use Markdown or MDX, just create a page with the `.md` or `.mdx` extension. The content of the file will be rendered as a React Server Component.

Create a page named `readme.mdx` with the following content in your root directory for pages:

```md
# Hello MDX!

This is an MDX page.
```

This route will available at `/readme` instantly.

Because your Markdown/MDX document will be rendered as a React Server Compoennt, it will also support all React features, like client components, loading fallbacks and error boundaries. Like on all standard pages.

Your parent layouts will also be applied to your Markdown/MDX pages.

> **Fun fact:** This documentation website was also created by using MDX with the file-system based router.

## Plugins
</Link>

You can use any Remark or Rehype plugin with the file-system based router. Just install the plugin and add it to your `react-server.config.mjs` file. In the following example, we use `remark-gfm` and `rehype-highlight`.

```mjs
import rehypeHighlight from "rehype-highlight";
import rehypeMdxCodeProps from "rehype-mdx-code-props";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";

export default {
  mdx: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight, rehypeMdxCodeProps],
  },
};
```

## Custom MDX components
</Link>

To use custom components, you have to create an `mdx-components.jsx` or `mdx-components.tsx` file in your project root. This file should export a `useMDXComponents` function that returns an object with the custom components.

```jsx
export default function useMDXComponents() {
  return {
    h1: (props) => <h1 style={{ color: "red" }} {...props} />,
  };
}
```

You can also specify where your file default exporting the `useMDXComponents` function is located in your `react-server.config.mjs` file.

```mjs
export default {
  mdx: {
    components: "./src/mdx-components.jsx",
  },
};
```
