# Outlets

Outlets are a powerful feature of the file-system based router that allows you to create nested layouts and reuse components in your app. You can add outlets to your layouts by defining routes in a subdirectory of your layout with a name starting with `@`. When the route under your outlet directory matches the URL, the component exported from that route definition file will be passed as a React prop to your layout component.

<Link name="implementation">
## Implementation
</Link>

You can add outlets to your layouts by defining routes in a subdirectory of your layout with a name starting with `@`. When the route under your outlet directory matches the URL, the component exported from that route definition file will be passed as a React prop to your layout component.

```txt
src
- (main).layout.jsx
- (main).page.jsx
- @sidebar
  - (sidebar).page.jsx
```

```jsx
// (main).layout.jsx

export default function RootLayout({ sidebar, children }) {
  return (
    <main>
      {sidebar}
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```

```jsx filename="@sidebar/(sidebar).page.jsx"
export default function Sidebar() {
  return <aside>...</aside>;
}
```

<Link name="client-side-navigation">
## Client-side navigation
</Link>

To make outlets available for [client-side navigation](/router/client-navigation), you can use the `ReactServerComponent` component from the `@lazarv/react-server/navigation` module. But using the file-system based router, the server-side rendering is handled automatically for each outlet. You can fine-tune the navigation of your app by using the [Link](/router/client-navigation#navigation) and [Refresh](/router/client-navigation#refresh) components from the same module when using outlets. Combining an initial content using the outlet available as the prop in your layout component and client-side navigation with the `ReactServerComponent` component, you can create a powerful navigation system for your app.

```jsx filename="(main).layout.jsx"
import { ReactServerComponent } from "@lazarv/react-server/navigation";

export default function RootLayout({ sidebar, children }) {
  return (
    <main>
      <ReactServerComponent outlet="sidebar">
        {sidebar}
      </ReactServerComponent>
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}
```
