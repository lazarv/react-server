# Deploy

When you're finished with your app, you can deploy it to the web. The framework provides a set of adapters to deploy your app to different platforms. You can also use the framework's built-in server to deploy your app to your own server using Node.js.

You will learn how to use [adapters](/deploy/adapters) to configure your app for different deployment environments.

You can also learn how to deploy your app to different platforms using the available adapters. The framework provides adapters for [Vercel](/deploy/vercel) right now, but there are more coming soon to deploy your app to Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, or Serverless Stack.

Find more information about how to implement deployment adapters in the [Adapter API](/deploy/api) section.
