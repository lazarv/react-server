# Deploy

When you're finished with your app, you can deploy it to the web. The framework provides a set of adapters to deploy your app to different platforms. You can also use the framework's built-in server to deploy your app to your own server using Node.js.

You will learn how to use [adapters](/deploy/adapters) to configure your app for different deployment environments.

You can also learn how to deploy your app to different platforms using the available adapters. The framework provides adapters for [Vercel](/deploy/vercel) and [Cloudflare](/deploy/cloudflare) right now, with more adapters coming soon.

Find more information about how to implement deployment adapters in the [Adapter API](/deploy/api) section.
