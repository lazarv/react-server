## CLI

The `react-server` CLI is the main tool for developing and deploying your `@lazarv/react-server` applications. It provides a set of commands to help you build, run, and deploy your app.

To check out the available commands, run:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server --help
```

### Commands

You need to always define the entrypoint of your app as the first argument of the `react-server` command. Only exception is when you use the `@lazarv/react-server-router` package as it will define the entrypoint for you.

- **[root]**: start development server for your app
- **build [root]**: build your app for production
- **start**: start your app in production

The `[root]` of your app has to export default a React Server Component. This is the entrypoint of your app and this will be rendered on the server side for every request.

### Development server options

If your entrypoint is at `./App.jsx`, you can start the development server with:

```sh
pnpm exec react-server ./App.jsx
```

To start the development server, you can use the following options:

**host:** The host to listen on. Default is `localhost`.

**port:** The port to listen on. Default is `3000`.

**https:** Use HTTPS protocol. Default is `false`.  
When you want to use HTTPS for your development server. You need to specify your HTTPS configuration in your `react-server.config.mjs` or `vite.config.mjs` file. See details in the Vite documentation at [server.https](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https).

**open:** Open browser on server start. Default is `false`.  
Opens your app in the default browser.

**cors:** Enable CORS. Default is `false`.  
This is useful when you want to allow cross-origin requests. If you need more detailed CORS configuration, you can define the CORS configuration in your `react-server.config.mjs` or `vite.config.mjs` file. See details in the Vite documentation at [server.cors](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors).

**force:** Force optimize deps. Default is `false`.  
This is equal to `vite --force`. It will force the optimization of dependencies and clears the Vite cache.

**clear-screen:** Clear screen on server start. Default is `false`.  
If you want to start with a clean terminal screen.

**no-color:** Disable color output. Default is `false`.  
This is useful for CI/CD environments.

**version:** Display version number.  
Output will also include your machine's architecture and node.js version.

### Build options

**minify:** Minify your build. Default is `true`.  
You don't need to minify your app if you only use React Server Components and you are not using any client components, like in the [Todo](https://github.com/lazarv/react-server/tree/main/examples/todo) example. If you want to disable minification of client component code, use `--no-minify`.

**sourcemap:** Generate source map. Default is `false`.
See more details in the Vite documentation at [build.sourcemap](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-sourcemap).

**no-color:** Disable color output. Default is `false`.  
This is useful for CI/CD environments.

**server:** Build server. Default is `true`.  
You can disable server build if you only want to build the client part of your app. Use `--no-server` to disable server build.

**client:** Build client. Default is `true`.  
You can disable client build if you only want to build the server part of your app. Use `--no-client` to disable client build.

**export:** Static export. Default is `false`.  
You can export your app as static HTML pages. You can define the routes to export in your `react-server.config.mjs` file. See more details at [Static generation](/guide/router/static).

**deploy:** Deploy using adapter. Default is `false`.
If you use an adapter in your `react-server.config.mjs` file, the adapter will pre-build your app for deployment and when you use this argument, the adapter will also deploy your app at the end of the build process.

### Start options

**host**, **port**, **https** and **cors** are the same as in the development server options.

**origin:**  
Specify the origin part of the URL to a constant value. Same as using the `ORIGIN` environment variable.

**trust-proxy:**
Trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

See more details about `origin` and `trust-proxy` at the Hattip documentation at [@hattip/adapter-node](https://github.com/hattipjs/hattip/tree/main/packages/adapter/adapter-node#api).

**build:**
Runs the build command before starting the server using the provided entrypoint.

**dev:**
Start the server in development mode to use React development packages, like `react/jsx-dev-runtime`.
