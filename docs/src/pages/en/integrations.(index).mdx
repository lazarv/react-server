# Integrations

In this section you will find guides on how to integrate `@lazarv/react-server` with different tools and third-party libraries.

`@lazarv/react-server` is built on top of [Vite](/integrations/vite), so most of the integrations that are available for Vite are also available for this framework too. You are not just able to use the same configuration for both Vite and `@lazarv/react-server`, but you are also able to use any Vite plugins in your project. You can also learn how to [migrate](/integrations/vite#migration) an existing Vite React project to use server-side rendering capabilities.

When you want to use TypeScript or Tailwind CSS with `@lazarv/react-server`, you can learn how to configure [TypeScript](/integrations/typescript) and how to install and configure [Tailwind CSS](/integrations/tailwind-css) to work with this framework.

You can also learn in this section how to integrate third-party libraries like [TanStack Query](/integrations/react-query), [Mantine UI](/integrations/mantine) and [Material UI](/integrations/mui) with `@lazarv/react-server`.
